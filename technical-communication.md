## NoSql Databases:-
- MongoDb
- Apache Cassandra
- Couchbase
- Redis
- Amazon DynamoDB
- Apache HBase

### MongoDB:-
 - It is a document-oriented database which makes it easy and optimized to store all information or data types in a single document.
 - It stores data in JSON-like format with optional schemas.
 - It also offers indexing, ad hoc queries and real time functions to access and analyze data.
 - It is horizontally scalable thorugh process called database sharding.
    
  **Uses:-**
   - Due to flexibility in schemas, it can be used to store data where there is no fixed information is not present. E.g:- Database of a social media.
   - It is good database in terms of scalability and storing huge data. E.g:- Goverment wbesite like IRCTC.

### Apache Cassandra:-
 - It is a free, open-source NOSQL database.
 - It has been designed to distribute across multiple servers.
 - Proven fault tolerance and linear scalability on cloud infrastructure or commodity hardware make Cassandra a perfect choice for mission-critical data.
 - It can handle failed replacements of nodes without shutting down the system.

   **Uses:-**
     - It can be scaled up or down easily.
     - It uses its on own query lnaguage, which is similar to SQL query language.
     - Due to its fault tolerant it can be used in banking databses or where data consistency is important.

### Couchbase:-
 - It is a open source, distributed, document database that has been specifically optimized for interactive applications.
 - It offers simplicity, speed, and scalability.

   **Uses:-**
     - It uses Sql queries so it becomes easy for a sql developer to work on it.
     - It includes a build in cached for speed so it is useful where we require fast database like in air controller database.
     - It is cloud friendly.

### Redis:-
 - It is another open-source NOSQL database that works in memory and can also be used as a cache.
 - It also possesses bitmaps, range queries, streams, along with data structures like sets, hashes, strings, sorted sets and lists.
 - It is written in ANSI C.

   **Uses:-**
     - Data resides in memory, which makes it possible to achieve very low latency and high throughput.
     - It suppports a large number of data structures, so we're not limited in type of data used.
     - It supports replication and persistence for reliable data storage and retrieval.
