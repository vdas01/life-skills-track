# Learning Process:-

 ## 1) 
 **The easiest way to improve your understanding is by explaining others in a simple way using examples, then identifying areas that hold your explanation and again going for revision of those topics.** <br>
 ## 2) 
 **The most interesting idea for me is to use Foucs mode and Diffuse mode during work or during solving problem interchangeably because during focus mode we try to only think on one possible solution or path and try to go deep in it but in diffuse mode we try at multiple path or solutions so we can try to discover as many path or solutions during diffuse mode and use all those and see the result in focus mode.** <br>

## 3)
**Active thinking is when we are focused and give consistent effort in any one task or problem. This is a more analytical approach, going deep in a particular path or task.** <br>
**Whereas in passive thinking, our mind is more relaxed and we are not in focused state of our mind. In this our mind focuses on more than on topic, which leads to more creativity as we are not bound to any particular path or solution but rather are open to many options / paths.** <br>


## 4) 
**1) Deconstruct the skill(decide what exactly what you are able to do when you are done, and then look into the skill and break it down into smaller).** <br>
**2) Learn enough to self-correct. (Take 4-5 resources on any topic but don't assume that you will practice once all resources are completed. No practice simuntaneosuly).** <br> 
**3) Remove practice distractions (e.g., television, internet).** <br> 
**4) Practice for atleast 20hrs.** <br> 

## 5)
**To improve my learning process, some steps I will take are:
1) Eating light and healthy so that I can remain productive in the office most of the time.
2) Staying away from distractions like clubs, drinking alcohol, etc.
3) Having a close group of like-minded friends who are goal-oriented and disciplined
4) Being punctual with my work and also being dedicated to my work.
