# Learning Process:-

### 1) The easiet way to improve your understanding is through explaining others in a simple way using examples and then identifying areas which hold your explanation and again going for revision of that topics.
### 2) The most interesting idea for me is to use Foucs mode and Diffuse mode during work or during solving problem interchangeably because during focus mode we try to only think on one possible solution or path and try to go deep in it
###  but in diffuse mode we try at multiple path or solutions so we can try to discover as much path or solution during diffuse mode and use all those and see the result in focus mode.

### 4) 
1) Deconstruct the skill(decide what exactly what you are able to do when you are done and then look into the skills and break it down into smaller)
2) Learn enough to self correct. (Take 4-5 resources on any topic but donn't procastinate that you will practice once all resources gets completed. No practice simuntaneosuly).
3) Remove practice distractions(e.g:- television, internet)
4) Practice for atleast 20hrs.
