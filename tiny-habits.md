# Tiny Habits

### Q1) In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
- The idea to develop any new habit
- Format:- After I existing behaviour, i will do new habit.
- Existing behaviour that we do everyday with same frequency and want to do new habit with same frequency then old habit becomes our trigger.
- Focus on changing behaviour rather than on outcome.
- Beak it into tiny habits and put into right spot then you don't have to do anything.

### Q2) How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.
- M :- Motivation; A:- Ability; P:- Prompt.

1. Shrink the behaviour.
- To understand how motivation interact with ability.
- shrink every new habit into tiny habits with big impact so that very less motivation is needed to do.
2. Identify an action prompt.
- External:- phone remainders, alarms.
- Internal :- Thoughts, feelings that remind you to act.
- Action:- Completion of one behaviour reminds you start another.
- Fit tiny habits between action habits.
- Example:- after i start my morning coffee , i will set out my vitamins.
3. Grow your habit with some shine.
- Shine is feeling that you get after completion of your habit.
- Example:- when you complete your project and your favourite teachers compliments you.
- Celebrate tiny successs which increases your motivation to do more difficult task.

### Q3) Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)
- Celebrating after each successful completion of habit gives our brain motivation to do more difficult tasks.
- It creates a sense of fulfillment within ourselves.

### Q4) In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
- I liked to story of Quality vs Quantity.
- We should try doing things and learn from our mistake.
- Rather than waiting to become perfect at something and then try we should keep it doing and learn from our imperfections.
- We should make mistakes but get back to track quickly as we shouldn't break the chain of doing the thing.

### Q5) What is the book's perspective about Identity?
- Identity is our believe.
- Most people try to workout from outcome to identity rather than identity to outcome.
- The ultimate form of intrinstic motivation is when habit becomes part of our identity.
- When we solve problems for outcomes and results then we solve them temporarily.
- But when we solve problem for longer term at system level then we need to change our identity.

### Q6) Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?
- Try to make it obvious and create an environment that exposes you to good habits.
- Make it look attractive, and try to take advantage of what we know about dopamine that helps us stick to it.
- Reduce the friction between you and the good habits.
- Give immediate rewards which will give our brain short-term bursts of dopamine.

### Q7) Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?
- Make the bad habits more difficult to do or follow.
- Make action look ugly or unattractive .
- Try to increase the friction between you and your bad habits.
- Reward should be  unstatisfying and delayed
